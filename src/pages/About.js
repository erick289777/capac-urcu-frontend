        <h2>About Capac Urcu</h2>
        <p>
          Capac Urcu was founded to bridge the gap between organic production and environmental conservation. Our journey began in Ecuador, a country known for its rich biodiversity and quality agriculture. By collaborating with Ecuadorian producers, we bring the countryâ€™s finest offerings to new markets while contributing to both nature and communities.

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          Capac Urcu was born from a deep love for nature and a passion for sustainable living. Founded by an Ecuadorian mountaineer and rock climber, the inspiration for our name comes from the Altar volcano, known as "Capac Urcu" in the Inca language, which means "Great Mountain." This majestic peak in Ecuador, with its striking landscapes and untouched beauty, sparked a vision to protect and share the wonders of our planet. Starting in Romania, we aim to bring a piece of Ecuador's natural abundance to the world, while championing global environmental conservation.
