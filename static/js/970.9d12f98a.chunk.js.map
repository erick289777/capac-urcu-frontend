Founded by an Ecuadorian mountaineer and rock climber, the inspiration for our name comes from the Altar volcano, known as \"Capac Urcu\" in the Inca language, which means \"Great Mountain.\" This majestic peak in Ecuador, with its striking landscapes and untouched beauty, sparked a vision to protect and share the wonders of our planet. Starting in Romania, we aim to bring a piece of Ecuador's natural abundance to the world, while championing global environmental conservation.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </section>\r\n\r\n      <img src={flower} alt=\"Flower\" className=\"section-image\" />\r\n\r\n      <section id=\"our-vision\">\r\n        <h3>Our Vision</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          We strive for a sustainable future where businesses actively support communities and ecosystems.
