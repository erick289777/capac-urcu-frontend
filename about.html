            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Capac Urcu was born out of a deep love for Ecuador, a place I proudly call paradise. With its diverse landscapes, rich culture, and exquisite flavors, Ecuador has always inspired me. My passion for mountaineering and rock climbing has led me to the majestic peaks of the Altar volcano, my favorite mountain and the heart of my inspiration. After moving to Romania in 2018, I felt a growing desire to share the beauty of my homeland. Capac Urcu is my way of bringing a piece of Ecuador to the world, one authentic flavor at a time.</p>
